Analysis

We are given two strings —

s → which we need to match
p → which has the pattern
There can be two special characters —

* → This can match 0 or more characters right before it. For e.g. if s = aa and p = a*, then * in p can match 0 or more a (because a is right before *).
Thus, we can have one a in place of *, and we are left with only one a in both s and p, which is same. Hence, s and p are a match.

. → This can match any single character. For e.g., if s = ab and p = .*, then since, . is right before * which means * can be replaced by ..
This makes p = .. which means there can be any two characters. These “any two characters” can be a and b, hence, it’s a match.

Approach

To understand the approach, let’s take some examples —

s = "aa" and p = "aa", since all the character in both s and p are same, hence it’s a match.

Now, what about s = "aabb" and p = "aab*" 🤔? We know that substrings bb and b* are match because * can be replaced by one b. Since, we already know that remaining substrings aa and aa are match, hence the whole strings also a match.

What can we infer from this? Right, if we have solution of part of a problem, we can use that partial result and can go forward. Also, we can use the already calculated result without calculating it again.

Does this ring a bell 🔔? Yes, this problem satisfies the following two properties -

Optimal Substructure — Any problem has optimal substructure property if its overall optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

Overlapping Subproblems — Any problem has overlapping sub-problems if finding its solution involves solving the same subproblem multiple times.
It is now evident that we can use good old Dynamic Programming to solve this problem.

Time Complexity
Since we are dealing with each character of both s and p the time complexity will be O(m × n) where m and n are the lengths of s and p respectively.

Space Complexity
We need a DP array for our intermediate operations of dimensions m × n, hence the space complexity will also be O(m × n).
