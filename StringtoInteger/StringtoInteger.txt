Approach
Idea:

The main idea is to iterate the string until we get the first digit part of the string or we traversed the whole string
(i.e index goes out of bound).

So, first, we traverse and ignore leading whitespaceâ€™s then check for positive or negative signs
if no sign character is present in the string then by default we take the digit is positive.

And finally, we traverse until our character is in the range of int and we will end our loop when we get a character
other than digit or digit goes beyond the Integer range.

Remember if digit >=INT_MAX then we return INT_MAX or if digit <=INT_MIN then we return INT_MIN.

Complexity Analysis for String to Integer (atoi) LeetCode Solution
Time complexity: O(N) because we are traversing each character in the input at most once and for each character we spend a constant amount of time.
